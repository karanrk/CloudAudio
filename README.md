# Cloud Audio Capture

### The Goal of this project is to successfully capture Audio data with maker kit microphone and develop low pass filter and capture data upto maximum frequency of 22Khz.

## Specifics
1. include an analog low­pass filter that reduces frequencies above approximately 8KHz.To use technical terms, the ­3dB “cutoff frequency” should be between 7.5KHz and
    8.0KHz.
2. Correctly capture audio signals up to a maximum frequency of 22KHz
3. Store audio signals with 16­bit precision.
4. Include a pressable button that triggers audio capture
5. Capture five seconds of audio when triggered (via the button press)
6. Upload the captured audio data to the cloud
7. Make the captured audio playable via a web browser in either a WAV or MP3 format.

## Resources

### Low Pass Filter 
* RC filter
### Cloud Server
Created our own interface to capture the audio data and convert it to wav file.
